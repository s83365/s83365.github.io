      <h2>Who Is The Enigmatic Young Entrepreneur Running This Website?</h2>
      <p>I am 17 years old and I like video games, movies, music, books, comedy, fitness, cars, politics and computers/technology. I started programming Scratch at a summer camp in 4th grade and then I tried Python later that year (which I didnt understand at all at the time). I took a Java class in my Sophomore year of high school and then learned C, Python, and SQL this year. I have been making things in HTML/CSS for a little while but I'm still figuring out how to make a website look good. As you can probably tell I'm not a graphic designer or anything but I think it's alright.
        <br>
        As for other stuff I've been using computers for 8-9 years, playing guitar for 5, lifting weights for about 2, driving for almost 1.
        <br>
        I have a 4-point-something GPA (3.8-something cumulative I'm pretty sure) and absolutely no work experience but I do have "prospects" such as my big ole brain and scattered knowledge in various subjects (I'm sort of a jack of all trades, master of none but once I figure out what I'm gonna do, that will change). I'm hoping to go to college for some sort of tech/engineering job (probably Software Engineering) at a university where I can get my Bachelor's for cheap (so most likely in-state). My dream colleges (read: pipe dreams) are Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T., maybe Amherst.
        <br>
        I own a Lenovo IdeaPad running Windows 10 (mostly for gaming) and an Acer Chromebook running GalliumOS (a Debian derivative). I haven't been using Linux for very long but I am a fan of their philosophy concerning FOSS and preferring CLI over GUI.
        <br>
        My favorite video game is Counter Strike, my favorite movie is Trainspotting, my favorite band is The Smiths, my favorite book is probably either Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or Kafka's Metamorphosis, my favorite comedian is Norm MacDonald or Tom Green, my favorite lift is the Overhead Press, my favorite car is the Lotus Esprit SE Turbo or the Toyota Supra (Mk3), probably not going to put anything for politics, and my favorite coding language is Python.
        <br>
        I live on a beautiful beachfront property on a private island. The following slideshow contains only some of the scenery I'm surrounded by every single day. Are you jealous yet? Try to go to sleep tonight knowing I live like a God on Earth and people like you only exist to make me marginally richer than I already am.

        <li>Tell me how much you love the 'site at newsupplementjuic3d@gmail.com <strong>[YES THIS IS MY REAL EMAIL]</strong> (ask about pre-ordering my new supplement as well; available in both suppository and liquid form. Shipping only available in China for now but we probably will start expanding to other East Asian countries in ~2.5-3 years)</li>

      <p>Hit me up at the above e-mail, but only if you are 1000% serious about boxing. I am 5'4" 90lbs (50 cm and 45 kg for you third worlders out there) but despite my size I've taken out guys 2 feet taller and 300 pounds heavier than me. If you believe you're up to the challenge I'll fly absolutely anywhere in the world to come fight you. Be forewarned: I will not be held responsible for you or your family's safety (or lack thereof) before, during, or after the fight.
        <br>
        I'm available to grapple (I'm a certified black belt in BJJ) as well between the hours of 6pm and 2am but only in North and South America.

              What did you just do? Do you think you're funny or something? I told you NOT to click the button, and you did the exact opposite. Just think if there was some shocking image or video placed here, something real distasteful that sticks in your head. You could have seen something you really didn't want to. Something so grotesque that even if you closed this box the second you caught a glimpse of it, it still keeps you up at night. All I'm saying is that curiousity killed the cat. Maybe sometimes it's better to listen to the website and not click on strange boxes. Before you close this message, meditate on death for a little while. Now move on, get out of my sight.
