      <p>Newest update (as of RIGHT NOW): <em>Ukraine and Russia got ice cream and became friends again, also Taiwan and China were never fighting it was all just a big misunderstanding like in an old sitcom. Thank you for being a friend.</em></p>
      <p>Older update: <em>I live on a beautiful beachfront property on a private island. The following slideshow contains only some of the scenery I'm surrounded by every single day. Are you jealous yet? Try to go to sleep tonight knowing I live like a God on Earth and people like you only exist to make me marginally richer than I already am.</em></p>

      <h2>What is MySpace 2?</h2>
      <p> The purpose of this website is to intertain the audeince of the web site...if you don't like it / have any qualms with me or my son -- yes I do live in Northern Missouri, and, yes, we can slap box. No holds barred, 3 rounds, no items. </p>
      <p> The purpose of this website is to develop new experimental Web-3.0 technology via the Blockchain and the erosion of anonymity </p>
      <p> The purpose of this website is to help users learn the Inglish langage, and to become better members of their communities and society as a hole. </p>
      <p> The real true purpose of this website is to recruit new members into a secret society. The password for the gate is Lipton. The password for the door is Benadryl. We meet at sundown. Be ready. </p>
      <p> The porpoise of this web sight is two let are userbase have fun in a relaxed calming environment with like minded individuals :) </p>
      <p> The purpose of this website is to breathe, eat, sleep etc.</p>
      <h2>Who is the enigmatic young entrepreneur running this website?</h2>
      <p>I am 17 years old and I like video games, movies, music, books, comedy, fitness, cars, politics and computers/technology. I started programming Scratch at a summer camp in 4th grade and then I tried Python later that year (which I didnt understand at all at the time). I took a Java class in my Sophomore year of high school and then learned C, Python, and SQL this year. I have been coding in HTML for a little while but I'm still figuring out how to make a website look good. As you can probably tell I'm not a graphic designer or anything but I think it's alright.</p>
      <p>As for other stuff I've been using computers for 8-9 years, playing guitar for 5, lifting weights for about 2, driving for almost 1. I have only ever used Windows and Mac for the most part, but I do have a Chromebook that I installed Debian (iirc) on which I haven't figured out how to use yet.</p>
      <p>I have a 4-point-something GPA (3.8-something cumulative I'm pretty sure) and absolutely no work experience but I do have "prospects" such as my big ole brain and scattered knowledge in various subjects (I'm sort of a jack of all trades, master of none but once I figure out what I'm gonna do, that will change). I'm hoping to go to college for some sort of tech/engineering job (probably Software Engineering) at a university where I can get my Bachelor's for cheap (so most likely in-state). My dream colleges (read: pipe dreams) are Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T., maybe Amherst.</p>
      <p>I own a Lenovo IdeaPad running Windows 10 (mostly for gaming) and an Acer Chromebook running GalliumOS (a Debian derivative). I haven't been using Linux for very long but I am a fan of their philosophy concerning FOSS and preferring CLI over GUI.</p>
      <p>My favorite video game is Counter Strike, my favorite movie is Taxi Driver, my favorite band is The Smiths, my favorite book is probably either Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or Kafka's Metamorphosis, my favorite comedian is Norm MacDonald or Tom Green, my favorite lift is the Overhead Press, my favorite car is the Lotus Esprit SE Turbo or the Toyota Supra (Mk3), probably not going to put anything for politics, and my favorite coding language is Python.</p>
      <h2 class="special"><strong>I HOPE YOU ENJOY THIS WEBSITE</strong></h2>
      <h1 id="contact" class="header">Contact</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Tell me how much you love the 'site at newsupplementjuic3d@gmail.com (ask about pre-ordering my new supplement as well; available in both suppository and liquid form. Shipping only available in China for now but we probably will start expanding to other East Asian countries in ~2.5-3 years)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hit me up at the above e-mail, but only if you are 1000% serious about boxing. I am 5'4" 90lbs (50 cm and 45 kg for you third worlders out there) but despite my size I've taken out guys 2 feet taller and 300 pounds heavier than me. If you believe you're up to the challenge I'll fly absolutely anywhere in the world to come fight you. Be forewarned: I will not be held responsible for you or your family's safety (or lack thereof) before, during, or after the fight.</p>
      <p>I'm available to grapple (I'm a certified black belt in BJJ) as well between the hours of 6pm and 2am but only in North and South America.</p>
